## Introduction
A web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites is built.

* The app should make a successful call to the api on form submission.
* Information from the api response must show up in the view.
* The project must have set up service workers in webpack.
* JS files are tested with Jest.

## Getting Started
* For Production Mode: 
Use `npm run build-prod` then `npm start` 
* For Development Mode: 
Use `npm run build-dev`
